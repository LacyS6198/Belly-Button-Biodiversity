# Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that research participants can use to see details behind their belly button bacteria. 
By participating in the study, each participant's belly button bacteria was analyzed. Researchers wanted to make this data available to study participants in an accessible way. 
To do this, a website was created that allows the selection of the ID a participant was assigned. Once selected, they can see full details regarding their own Belly Button Biodiversity!
